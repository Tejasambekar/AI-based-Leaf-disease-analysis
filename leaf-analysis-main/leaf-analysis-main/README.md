Leaf Analysis 🌿


How to Run the Project
Follow the steps below to set up and run both the backend (Flask server) and frontend (React
app) of this project.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/sravankumar21/leaf-analysis.git

2. Open the Project
● Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice).

3. Start the Backend (Flask Server)
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend
Run the Flask server:
python3 app.py
● This will start the backend server where deep learning models are integrated.
(Models are pre-downloaded and saved in .h5 format inside the backend/models
folder.)

4. Start the Frontend (React App)
● Open a new terminal window (do not stop the backend server).

From the project root directory, install frontend dependencies:
npm install
Once installation is complete, start the React app:
npm start
● Your browser will open automatically and navigate to the home page of the application.
